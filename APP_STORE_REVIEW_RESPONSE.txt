GUIDELINE 2.1 - INFORMATION NEEDED RESPONSES
---------------------------------------------

Question 1: How do users obtain personalized meal planning in the app?

Answer: 
Users can create personalized meal plans completely FREE of charge directly within the app. The process works as follows:

1. User taps "Meal Planner" tab and creates a new meal plan (no payment required)
2. They select recipes from our database of 20+ recipes, each with complete nutritional information
3. Recipes can be assigned to specific dates and meal types (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)
4. The app automatically:
   - Calculates total daily nutrition based on selected meals
   - Generates a shopping list with all required ingredients
   - Combines duplicate ingredients with summed quantities
5. Users can track purchased items and manage multiple meal plans
6. All data is saved locally on the device using UserDefaults

The meal planning feature is personalized based on the user's selected health goal (Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, Maintenance, or Healthy Eating). The app recommends recipes that align with their chosen goal, but users are free to select any recipes they prefer.

This personalization happens in three ways:
- During onboarding, users select their health goal
- Recipe recommendations are filtered based on the selected goal
- Restaurant menu items are highlighted if they match the user's health goals

Question 2: Do users have to pay for it? If so, where and how is the payment made?

Answer: 
NO, users do NOT have to pay for any features in KanGastronomia. The entire app is completely free to use:

✅ FREE FEATURES:
- Unlimited meal plan creation
- Access to all 20+ recipes
- Restaurant finder with 10 restaurants
- Automatic shopping list generation
- Complete nutritional information
- All personalization features

❌ NO PAYMENTS:
- No subscription required
- No in-app purchases
- No hidden fees
- No payment collection of any kind
- No monetization features

All features including meal planning, recipe browsing, restaurant finder, and shopping lists are available to all users at no cost. The app does not contain any payment processing functionality, subscription systems, or monetization features.

The app is designed as a free utility to help users plan healthy meals and discover nutritious recipes, with no commercial transactions involved.
